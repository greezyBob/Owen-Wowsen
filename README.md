# SEI-Project-Two: Owen Wowsen


## Overview
This was the second project for the Software Engineering Immersive course with GA, which consisted of a hackathon over the course of a day and a half. I was paired with [klobbob](https://github.com/kobbob), and together we worked to plan, wireframe, and code the website.

You can find the deployed version of our project [here](tbc).

## The Brief

**Timeframe:**
* <36 hours

**General Project Brief:**
* Consume a public API – this could be anything but it must make sense for your project
* Have several components - At least one classical and one functional
* The app should include a router - with several “pages”
* Include wireframes - that you designed before building the app
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public

## Technologies 

* JavaScript (ES6+)
* React & React Router
* HTML5 & CSS3
* Sass
* Chakra UI
* Axios
* [The Owen Wilson WoW API](https://owen-wilson-wow-api.herokuapp.com/)
* VSCode
* Eslint
* Git & GitHub
* Insomnia

## Planning
We started this project out by first spending time picking a suitable API for this project. We were limited to free APIs and were also conscious of any APIs with strict rate limiting and tight limits.

## Overview
We chose to keep our site simple and clean given the time constraints. With this in mind we kept the site to one main page rather than having multiple different pages a user could click to. In order to make requests to the api we used axios and saved the resulting data to vairables using the React useState and setState hooks.

For the design we opted for Chakra UI which allowed for a good amount of customisation whilst also having many prebuilt components that helped to speed up the design process. Chakra UI made it a lot easier to have a mobile first design. The site is fully compatible with mobile and had dark and light modes.


## Challenges
Working within a very short time frame meant really prioritizing certain aspects over others, such as working to implement core features for the user over other aspects that aren't a top priority.
